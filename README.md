#Extended_Kalman_Filters

Extended Kalman Filter implementation on a wheeled robot.

In EKF.m file, extended Kalman filter is implemented to estimate its positions and velocity given known correspondences.
While in EKF_unknown.m file,  extended Kalman filter is implemented to estimate its positions and velocity given unknown correspondences.

The rest files are for sensor models and vehicle kinematics, and some auxiliary functions are also included as m file.
